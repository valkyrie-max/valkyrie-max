# Hello stranger!

## Front End Developer. Japan lover. Mushrooms hater. 

* With the background in International Development and customer service, I care a lot about people and their needs, which directly translates in what I create. :sparkles:
* I am highly eager to learn new things, receive feedback and criticism, and improve my coding skills and abilities. 
* Some of my hobbies outside of coding and web development include (but not limited to!): learning human languages, writing small detective stories, gaming, anime, and manga.  

### Mediocre facts about me
