# Hello stranger!

## Front End Developer. Japan lover. Mushrooms hater. 

My name is Alisa and I code!
**I am available for hire! Feel free to contact me! You can find more info about me [here](https://alisacodes.dev/) and [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1t9MrJNhS59LveqX4k-a61l-sO2owt3zw/view?usp=sharing).**

*With the background in International Development and customer service, I care a lot about people and their needs, which directly translates in what I create with the code magic. :sparkles:
*I am highly eager to learn new things, receive feedback and criticism, and improve my coding skills and abilities. 
*Some of my hobbies outside of coding and web development include (but not limited to!): learning human languages, writing small detective stories, gaming, anime, and manga. 


I am also open to collaboration! Hmu: [here](https://twitter.com/alisacodes).
