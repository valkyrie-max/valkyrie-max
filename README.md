### About me 

I've always been proud of my determination and ability to meet any challenge head on. ᕕ( ᐛ )ᕗ

I am highly eager to learn new things, receive feeback and criticism, and improve my coding skills and abilities. 

Some of my hobbies outside of coding and web development include (but not limited to!): learning human languages, writing small detective stories, gaming, anime, and manga. 

I am open to collaboration! Hmu: [here](https://twitter.com/alisacodes). 

### What are you currently working on?
Right now (July, 2020) I am working on my [portfolio](https://alisacodes.dev/) redesign. 

### What are you planning on working in the future? 
[Here is the list of the project ideas](https://docs.google.com/document/d/11thLYvJ2EIhzrTC7sCoyNonenfBGjcCaZXV-9uZpMjg/edit?usp=sharing) I've got as of July 2020. This doc will be updated as I come up with more stuff! If you are interested in collaboration, [hmu](https://twitter.com/alisacodes).

### Fun facts? 
Uh... I'm left-handed..? Is that fun enough? (•ิ_•ิ)?
