### About me 

I've always been proud of my determination and ability to meet any challenge head on.

I am highly eager to learn new things, receive feeback and criticism, and improve my coding skills and abilities. 

Some of my hobbies outside of coding and web development include (but not limited to!): learning human languages, writing small detective stories, gaming, anime, and manga. 

I am open to collaboration! Hmu: [here](https://twitter.com/alisacodes). 

### Fun facts? 
Uh... I'm left-handed..? Is that fun enough? (â€¢à¸´_â€¢à¸´)?
